# ToonHQ Clone
This is a replication project because it's too hot to go outside.

## What is included in this project?

Front End
-----------

There will be a ToonHQ feel Front-End which will take requests from the Back End

Back End
----------

There will be a Back End that will be fully functional. 

I recommend running it on the latest release of Nginx (with proxy passing capabilities) and NodeJS.

## What is included in the API?

`/api/v1/invasion`
------------------

This returns the current invasion status data but includes a few more things.

`/api/v1/status`
----------------

This returns the server status data -- basically if the account server is up and the game-servers are up.

## Disclaimer

This project is just a fun little thing I planned to do. It was too hot to go outside and I was bored.
